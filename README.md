What is MVVM ?
Model-View-ViewModel is an architecural approach used to abstract the state and behaviour of a view, which allows us to separate the development of the UI from the business logic. This is accomplished by the introduction of a ViewModel, whos responsibility is to expose the data objects of a model and handle any of the applications logic involved in the display of a view.

This approach (MVVM) is made up of three core components, each with itâ€™s own distinct and separate role:

    Model - Data model containing business and validation logic
    View - Defines the structure, layout and appearance of a view on screen
    ViewModel - Acts a link between the View and Model, dealing with any view logic
